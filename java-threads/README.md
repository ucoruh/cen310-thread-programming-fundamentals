# üßµ Java Threading Programming Fundamentals

This project is a comprehensive educational material designed to teach you about thread programming and concurrency in Java. It covers various topics from basic thread creation to advanced concurrency patterns.

## üéØ Purpose of This Project

With this project, you will learn:
- How threads are created and managed
- Fundamental problems and solutions in concurrent programming
- Java's concurrency tools and their use cases
- Advantages and challenges of parallel programming

## üìä Thread Programming Visual Models

This project includes several PlantUML diagrams to help visualize threading concepts:

- **Java Thread API Class Diagram**: Located at [assets/java_threading.puml](assets/java_threading.puml) - Shows the relationships between main Java threading classes and interfaces

To generate PNG images from these PlantUML files, use the scripts provided in the `git-scripts` directory:

```bash
# Go to the git-scripts directory
cd ../git-scripts

# To generate all diagrams at once:
generate_all_diagrams.bat

# To generate only the Java threading diagram:
java -jar plantuml.jar ../java-threads/assets/java_threading.puml
```

## üìö Java Thread Model

### Thread Lifecycle
A thread goes through the following states:
1. **New**: Thread is created but not yet started
2. **Runnable**: Thread is ready to run, waiting for CPU time
3. **Blocked**: Thread is waiting for a monitor lock
4. **Waiting**: Thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action
5. **Timed Waiting**: Thread is waiting for a specific period
6. **Terminated**: Thread has completed execution

### Thread Creation Methods in Java

1. **Extending Thread Class**:
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           // Your thread code here
       }
   }
   MyThread t = new MyThread();
   t.start();
   ```

2. **Implementing Runnable Interface** (Preferred method):
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Your thread code here
       }
   }
   Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
   t.start();
   ```

3. **Using Lambda Expressions**:
   ```java
   Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
       // Your thread code here
   });
   t.start();
   ```

## üîí Synchronization

One of the most important topics in concurrent programming is ensuring safe access to shared data by multiple threads.

### Basic Synchronization Mechanisms

1. **synchronized Keyword**:
   ```java
   // Method-level synchronization
   public synchronized void increment() {
       counter++;
   }
   
   // Block-level synchronization
   public void increment() {
       synchronized(this) {
           counter++;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Lock Interface**:
   ```java
   private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   
   public void increment() {
       lock.lock();
       try {
           counter++;
       } finally {
           lock.unlock();
       }
   }
   ```

## üßÆ Executor Framework

Java's `java.util.concurrent` package provides a higher-level API for creating and managing threads.

### Basic Usage Examples

1. **Creating a Thread Pool**:
   ```java
   ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
   ```

2. **Submitting Tasks**:
   ```java
   executor.submit(() -> {
       System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
   });
   ```

3. **Shutdown**:
   ```java
   executor.shutdown();
   ```

## üß™ Student Exercises

1. **Thread Creation**: Create two different threads and assign different tasks to them.
2. **Synchronization**: Create threads that increment a shared counter and solve the race condition problem.
3. **Thread Pool**: Use ExecutorService to parallelize a file reading operation.
4. **Deadlock**: Create and solve a deadlock situation where two threads are waiting for each other.

## üìå Concurrent Programming Tips

1. **Minimize Shared Mutable State**: Minimize shared state variables to reduce synchronization issues.
2. **Prefer Immutability**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe.
3. **Use Higher-Level Concurrency Tools**: Prefer Executors, concurrent collections, and atomic variables over raw threads and synchronization.
4. **Proper Resource Management**: Always clean up resources (e.g., shutting down ExecutorServices).
5. **Acquire Locks in a Consistent Order**: Always acquire locks in the same order to prevent deadlocks.

## üîç Common Concurrency Issues

1. **Race Condition**: When behavior depends on the relative timing of events.
2. **Deadlock**: When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release locks.
3. **Livelock**: When threads keep changing their state in response to each other without making progress.
4. **Thread Starvation**: When a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources.
