Create a comprehensive Python threading tutorial project demonstrating threading concepts and multiprocessing in Python 3.8+. The project should:

1. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT:
   
   - Create complete tutorial documentation on Python concurrency options:
     * threading module basics
     * Thread creation and management
     * Synchronization with Lock, RLock, Semaphore
     * Thread communication with Event and Condition
     * Thread-local storage
     * The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and its implications
     * multiprocessing module for true parallelism
     * concurrent.futures for high-level abstractions
     * asyncio for asynchronous programming
     * Queue for thread-safe data exchange

2. IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES:
   
   - Create separate Python files for each concept:
     * basic_threads.py: Thread creation and management
     * synchronization.py: Using locks and other primitives
     * communication.py: Inter-thread communication patterns
     * producer_consumer.py: Threading communication with Queue
     * gil_implications.py: Demonstration of GIL limitations
     * multiprocessing_demo.py: Bypassing the GIL with processes
     * concurrent_futures.py: ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor
     * async_programming.py: asyncio and coroutines

3. PROJECT STRUCTURE:
   
   - Create a well-organized package structure:
     * threading_examples/ for threading module demos
     * multiprocessing_examples/ for multiprocessing demos
     * asyncio_examples/ for async programming
     * comparison/ for comparing different approaches
     * utilities/ for common utilities

4. ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
   
   - Include requirements.txt for dependencies
   - Add setup.py for package installation
   - Include Dockerfile for containerized testing
   - Create virtual environment setup scripts

5. DOCUMENTATION:
   
   - Create README.md with:
     * Python concurrency model explanation
     * GIL explanation and implications
     * When to use threading vs multiprocessing vs asyncio
     * Best practices for Python concurrency
     * Performance considerations
   - Add comprehensive docstrings using Google or NumPy style

6. EXERCISES:
   
   - Include progressively challenging exercises with solutions:
     * Web scraping with concurrent requests
     * Parallel data processing tasks
     * Building thread-safe data structures
     * Implementing producer-consumer patterns

7. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
   
   - Include benchmarking code comparing:
     * Single-threaded vs multi-threaded vs multiprocessing
     * CPU-bound vs IO-bound task performance
     * Thread overhead measurements
     * Visual performance comparisons

Ensure all code follows PEP 8 style guidelines, includes proper error handling, resource management using context managers, and comprehensive docstrings explaining each concept.
