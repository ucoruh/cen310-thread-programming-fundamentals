# Thread Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains comprehensive educational resources and code examples for thread programming in multiple languages:

- C (POSIX Threads)
- C++ (std::thread)
- Java (Thread and java.util.concurrent)
- C# (.NET Threading and TPL)
- Python (threading and multiprocessing)

## Repository Structure

Each language has its own directory with complete examples, documentation, and exercises:

- `c-threads/`: POSIX threads examples and tutorials
- `cpp-threads/`: Modern C++ threading tutorials
- `java-threads/`: Java threading and concurrent programming
- `csharp-threads/`: C# and .NET threading approaches
- `python-threads/`: Python threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio

## Learning Path

For each language, the examples progress from:

1. Basic thread creation and management
2. Thread synchronization mechanisms
3. Communication between threads
4. Thread safety patterns
5. Advanced concepts and libraries
6. Performance considerations

## Prerequisites

- C: GCC or Visual Studio, pthreads library
- C++: C++17 compatible compiler (MSVC, GCC, Clang)
- Java: JDK 11 or later, Maven or Gradle
- C#: .NET 6 SDK or later, Visual Studio 2022
- Python: Python 3.8 or later

## Getting Started

Each language directory contains its own README with specific instructions for building and running the examples.

## Common Threading Concepts

While the implementation details vary between languages, this repository demonstrates these core threading concepts:

- Thread creation and lifecycle
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Shared state management
- Thread communication
- Thread safety
- Performance optimization
